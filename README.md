**#BeatFlow**
BeatFlow is a web-based music player, developed using the create-react-app CLI. This project features a limited selection of songs hosted on Google Drive, allowing users to play, pause, and navigate through tracks in an interactive interface.

**#Description**
BeatFlow is a React-based music player. Leveraging song data from Google Drive, the app focuses on mimicking Spotify's UI and front-end behavior to deliver a familiar experience.

This project includes 24 songs for testing and demonstration purposes.

**#Features**
• Play and Pause music playback. <br /> • Full-fledged music player with time tracking and progress bar. <br /> • Select and switch between songs from the list. <br /> • Use the progress bar to adjust playback timing. <br />

**#Motivation**
The main goal behind BeatFlow was to strengthen my skills in React development by building a clone of a well-known product. Focusing on an established design like Spotify helped me concentrate on learning React without worrying about UI/UX. As a frequent music listener, I found this project to be both challenging and enjoyable. All key components and logic were built from scratch, deepening my understanding of React.

**#Tech/Framework Used**
• React (create-react-app CLI) <br /> • HTML <br /> • CSS <br /> • JavaScript <br />

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
